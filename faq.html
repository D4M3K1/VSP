  <h3>What is VSF?</h3>
  <p>VSF (Vines Special Forces) is a private, tactical-minded community built around anonymity, strategy, mutual support, and discussion. We aim to cultivate a space where members can exchange ideas, vent, express themselves freely, and find allies in various mental, social, and creative battles. It’s not just a group — it’s a support force.</p>

  <h3>Is this a mental health or tactical support group?</h3>
  <p>In a way — yes. VSF is a hybrid community offering moral support, critical thinking, resilience building, and space for expression. Whether you’re here to share strategies or struggles, you're welcome.</p>
